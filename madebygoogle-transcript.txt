0:08
>> SPEAKER 1: Hey, Google, call Carmen.
0:24
On my way. Let me grab the others.
0:29
>> SPEAKER 2: Oh, cool.
0:45
Yeah, I'll be on.
1:01
Give me one sec.
1:17
>> SPEAKER 3: Hey.
1:29
>> SPEAKER 1: Hi, come on in.
1:45
One, two, three. [Applause]. >> RICK: Hi, everyone, and welcome to Made By Google 2022. It's great to be back in a room with you and streaming live
1:51
around the world. We’re here in Brooklyn, New York at National Sawdust, a modern
1:57
community music venue just a few steps away from our newest Google Store, which opened earlier this summer.
2:05
Over the next hour, we’re going to give you an in-depth view at our new Pixel portfolio.
2:11
We’ll show you our new devices, and how they work together to create immersive ambient experiences.
2:18
So you can get the help you need wherever and whenever you need it, in a way that is effortless, private, and secure.
2:28
Every Pixel device is designed to deliver a level of personal intelligence that’s totally unique in the mobile computing
2:36
world, so day-to-day problems turn into delightful experiences.
2:42
Like making your photos that are blurry sharp in the blink of an eye, and magically erasing
2:50
distractions in your pictures. Or automatically reducing background noise on the other
2:57
end of your phone call. And protecting you from robo-callers and spam texts.
3:04
Or helping you understand more than 100 different languages with Lens in your camera.
3:13
You'll even know whether you should rest today or go for that extra mile on your run.
3:20
Pixel devices handle all that for you, thanks to our combination of foundational technologies: AI, Android, and
3:29
Google Tensor. This is where the "Google" in "Google Hardware" is such a
3:35
differentiator for our products. We're completely changing computing by pushing the
3:41
boundaries in AI innovation, in order to create helpful experiences for our users.
3:47
When you put that innovation to work in hardware devices, it leads to truly novel sets of features and capabilities.
3:56
Our Tensor mobile platform extends this approach right onto the silicon.
4:01
It was custom designed to support this new paradigm of computing systems, and pull our most advanced machine learning
4:08
models out of our research labs right in to Pixel hardware. It represents years of development across Google, and a
4:16
long-term investment in the Pixel portfolio. When we first put Tensor to work in Pixel 6, it was a huge step
4:25
forward, delivering amazingly helpful, Pixel-only experiences, like Live Translate, Magic Eraser, and Real Tone.
4:36
And over the summer, we brought Tensor to Pixel 6a, bringing a helpful Pixel experience at a great value.
4:45
The family of Pixel 6 and 6a has been the fastest-selling Pixel generation ever.
4:51
And we're just getting started. Now, today, you'll see what we've been building up to for a while.
4:58
A true Pixel portfolio of beautifully designed phones,
5:03
watches, tablets, and earbuds, all working together to deliver the magic
5:10
you expect from Google. Now, this is the future of where Pixel is going, because for us,
5:18
Pixel isn’t only a phone experience, it’s a personal, intelligent and cohesive computing experience.
5:28
And we’re excited to advance the Pixel computing experience this year with our new Google Tensor G2 mobile compute platform.
5:39
With Tensor G2, our phones and tablets can do so much more, and we've added a next-generation on-device TPU, which keeps up
5:48
with our rapidly evolving machine learning research. You’ll hear lots more about Google Tensor G2 today.
5:56
And we’ll give you an in-depth look at the new Pixel devices in the new Pixel portfolio, how they work for you and how they work together.
6:05
But just as important is how they look together, inside and out.
6:12
The new members of the Pixel family are some of the most beautifully refined products we've ever made.
6:18
And now, here's Isabelle to tell you a little bit more about our design process.
6:24
[Applause]. >> ISABELLE: Looking across the Pixel family, you’ll notice
6:33
everything shares a single design language that’s uniquely Pixel. So they fit together, even while they're designed for all kinds of different context and use
6:42
cases where technology can be helpful. A watch needs to be able to dress up for a night out, and be
6:48
durable enough to go with you When you’re camping or rock climbing. Earbuds need to stay put comfortably and give you
6:55
hands-free help when you’re in the middle of a long flight or a short walk or a challenging workout.
7:02
And your tablet should be able to travel with you, from the coffee shop to the couch to the kitchen.
7:08
And of course, your phone is your most constant companion.
7:13
the Google design team puts so much thought into how we embrace and enhance this fluidity.
7:19
Your phone and watch are designed to be personal, to be touched and worn.
7:24
Your phone gets pulled in and out of your bag and pocket hundreds of times per day. And they have smooth, rounded surfaces that always feel right
7:34
in your hand and on your wrist. And we’ve put together color combinations and
7:39
finishes that are totally unique to Google hardware, with different tones and textures for different collections of
7:46
products. With our newest Pixel phones, we’re introducing a zirconia-blasted aluminum that feels silky-smooth in your hand,
7:55
and a polished aluminum that lets the metal really shine. The metal construction is simpler than previous Pixel
8:03
phones, and it’s durable, to hold up against the ups and downs of life.
8:08
The metals and colors pair elegantly together, and they’re designed to work with the software, too, for this complete holistic
8:16
experience across the hardware and software. That’s the thinking behind Material You, which we launched
8:23
last year. Material You is an innovative approach to software design that intelligently customizes your Pixel UI around your own color
8:32
preferences and even your photos. Material You enhances the OS interface, settings,
8:40
notifications, and popular apps, for a fluid software experience that feels connected to the hardware.
8:46
We’re bringing our flexible, personal design approach to new devices, too, like Google Pixel Watch.
8:54
A watch is only helpful when it’s on your wrist, so we designed Pixel watch to be worn every day, with hardware and
9:01
software that look and feel great, no matter what.
9:07
Inspired by the continuous surface of a water droplet, the domed design makes the bezel visually disappear.
9:14
And it’s practical, too, comfortable on the wrist, and it doesn’t get in the way of shirts and sleeves.
9:21
And you should be able to decide how your watch fits your style. So you can choose from three distinct jewelry-inspired finishes in stainless steel.
9:30
They come in black, silver and gold. And you’ll get deep customization with our
9:37
innovative band system. You'll notice that the Pixel Watch doesn't have prominent external lugs like other watches
9:44
do. Instead, the bands attach internally, similar to how a camera lens attaches to a camera body.
9:51
Just twist and click, and you get a seamless transition between the watch and the band.
9:56
The system makes it so easy to swap between a wide variety of bands. And it completely transforms Pixel Watch to match your vibe.
10:06
With the Active band, you get the all-day flexibility of a fitness smartwatch. The stretch and woven bands are cozy and comfortable, so you can
10:14
wear your watch all the time, even overnight. And with the metal and leather bands you get a more classic
10:21
watch persona. You'll hear a lot more about the Pixel Watch experience later
10:26
today. From a design perspective, every element of the watch flows
10:31
together. From the band options, to the casing, to the personalization of the UI, and dozens of customizable watch faces.
10:40
So you can go with an analog or a digital look. Display as much or as little information as you’d like.
10:46
And if you want the traditional analog look of a leather band, but with a minimal digital watch face, go for it.
10:53
It will look great. Between the bands, finishes and watch faces, you have thousands
11:00
of combinations to make your Pixel Watch uniquely yours. It’s all part of the Pixel portfolio approach to colors and
11:08
finishes. We don’t just copy-paste one color we like across all of our
11:13
products. Instead, we use a spectrum of shades that are unique to different products, but come
11:18
together in a cohesive collection. So we have dark and light neutrals.
11:24
And our warm collection is designed around our new Lemongrass tone.
11:30
And we’ve created a cooler Family of colors, featuring our new Hazel hue.
11:36
Think of it like building out your wardrobe. Your pants or a jacket might be understated, and your sneakers
11:42
give you a pop of color. Everything goes nicely together without looking blandly the same.
11:49
We’re also excited for you to check out our new tablet. We wanted to create a larger screen that would be useful in
11:56
different contexts in your life. A device that fits in your home, and feels elegant in your
12:03
hand. So we developed an entirely new nano-ceramic coating inspired by
12:09
the fine texture of porcelain. It’s a custom finishing process where small ceramic particles
12:15
are infused into the coating that we apply to the tablet’s 100% recycled aluminum body.
12:22
This gives it a soft, matte, textured feel, like no other tablet. So we're introducing quite a few design innovations with the
12:32
Pixel portfolio. And the design approach goes beyond form and function.
12:37
We design for impact, too, across everything we do. From product design to manufacturing, and across our
12:45
communities and supply chains, we are being thoughtful about our environmental impact at every step.
12:51
At Google, we’ve set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our
12:59
consumer hardware products by 2030. For emissions associated with powering our data centers and
13:06
office campuses, we have an ambitious goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.
13:12
For the hardware team, net-zero emissions means we have to combine art and science to reimagine every single element
13:21
that goes into a product, the process we use to manufacture it, and the longevity you get out of it.
13:28
So the design team works closely with Google engineers to create new ways to incorporate recycled metals, plastics, glass, and
13:36
fabrics. And we're proud to announce today that every product you'll see today is made with recycled materials.
13:45
So the aluminum in the phone enclosure is made with 100 percent recycled content, reducing the enclosure’s overall
13:51
carbon footprint by over 35 percent. The watch case is made with 80% recycled steel.
14:00
Even the fabric on the stretch band I showed you is made with yarns that are 100 percent recycled.
14:07
We have a deep responsibility to create sustainable technologies. And I’m so proud to be part of a team of designers, product
14:15
engineers, and operations specialists who are doing impactful work to help our planet.
14:23
The other deep responsibility we have at Google is to our users’ privacy and security.
14:28
And over the years, we’ve developed a number of industry-leading technologies to protect your data.
14:34
I'll hand it off to Jen to tell you more. >> JEN: Thanks, Isabelle.
14:42
Every day, our teams of world-class privacy and security
14:47
experts help protect your personal information, by ensuring all Google products are secure by default, private by
14:55
design, and put you in control. This is critical, because we know that our products can only
15:01
be as helpful as they are safe. That’s why we’ve built Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro
15:07
to be our most secure and private phones yet. Pixel 7 has multiple layers of verifiable security with our
15:14
custom Google Tensor SOC, and our dedicated Titan M2 security chip.
15:20
Titan M2 is derived from the same chip we use to protect Google Cloud data centers, and it’s now Common Criteria
15:26
certified to the highest security level possible. Meaning that titan M2 meets the same rigorous protection guidelines
15:34
trusted by banks, carriers, and governments. Pixel 7 also provides five years of guaranteed security updates,
15:41
so your phone gets the latest security protections over time. When it comes to protecting your personal information,
15:49
world-class security is only half of the equation. The other is privacy, which is why everything we build is
15:55
private by design. At I/O earlier this year, we announced Protected Computing, a
16:01
growing toolkit of technologies, that transforms how, when, and where personal data is processed to protect your privacy.
16:10
With Protected Computing, we’re focusing on three areas. First, minimizing your data footprint, shrinking the amount
16:17
of personally identifiable data altogether. Second, de-identifying data so it’s not linked to you.
16:24
And third, restricting access to your data using technologies like end-to-end encryption and secure enclaves.
16:32
With Protected Computing, features like Live Translate, Spam detection in Messages, and Smart Reply provide intelligent,
16:41
personalized experiences, without any data leaving your device. And with Google Pixel 7, we’re using Protected Computing to
16:49
keep your health and wellness data private. For example, with your permission, Digital Wellbeing
16:55
can help you understand the quality of your sleep by analyzing audio from coughs and snores during the night.
17:01
That audio data is never stored by or sent to Google. The processing happens right on your Pixel 7.
17:08
Of course, not everything can be processed on your device. Like when you use your phone to browse the web.
17:15
This is where a virtual private network comes in. A VPN encrypts your network traffic to turn it into an
17:20
unreadable format and masks your original IP address, so your online activity stays private to you.
17:28
Later this year, Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro will be the first phones to come with a VPN, at no extra cost.
17:35
And unlike traditional VPN services, Google’s verifiably private VPN can’t associate app and browsing traffic with your
17:42
Google account or identity. With our continued investment in Protected Computing, I’m excited
17:49
to see how we can deliver even more private experiences across all of our products.
17:54
Of course, core to your safety is knowing that you’re in control. And with Android 13, we’re making it even easier, with
18:02
privacy and security settings all in one place. This includes new action cards that notify you of any safety
18:10
risks, and provide easy steps to enhance your privacy and security. This new experience will be available first on Pixel devices
18:17
later this year, and other Android phones soon after. With Protected Computing, hardware protection from Titan
18:25
M2, and centralized privacy and security settings, no one is deploying a more comprehensive approach to safety at this
18:32
scale. It's this type of innovation that helps us keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world.
18:39
Here’s Brian to tell you more about Pixel. [Applause].
18:47
>> BRIAN: As the Pixel portfolio expands, the phone is at the
18:54
center of it all. When we launched Pixel 6, we introduced the world to the first phone powered by Google Tensor, using our advances in AI
19:03
to create a more helpful experience, with features and capabilities you couldn’t get on any other phone.
19:10
Pixel has always been a leader in smartphone innovation, and we take it as a compliment when others in the industry follow our lead.
19:17
Like the always-on display and At a Glance, introduced with Pixel 2, putting useful info right on your lock screen.
19:24
There’s Night Sight, which launched with Pixel 3, and astrophotography, which set a new bar for low-light
19:30
photography on a smartphone. And we introduced Car Crash Detection three years ago, along
19:36
with other important ways to keep you safe, like Safety Check and Emergency Sharing. It’s an amazing track record of pioneering features that were
19:44
first on Pixel, and make the phone experience so much more helpful.
19:50
We even take a different approach in how we deliver our latest innovations. So much of the unique Pixel experience is software-defined,
19:58
which means that we can give your existing phone access to new features and upgrades, so your Pixel stays useful longer.
20:04
That’s the idea behind Pixel Feature Drops. Every few months, your phone gets new capabilities and
20:11
features, which means your Pixel gets even better over time.
20:16
And you'll be protected over time, too, with five years of security updates directly from Google.
20:22
With a steady stream of Feature Drops and ongoing security updates, Day One with your Pixel phone is just the first of many
20:29
best days to come. Speaking of Day One, I’m excited to show you the new standard for
20:35
smartphones. Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. They take all the helpfulness and personal intelligence people
20:42
love about Pixel, and make them even better. Pixel 7’s improvements start with the looks.
20:50
This is the ultimate refinement of Pixel, simplifying the parts and construction to make a phone that’s sophisticated and
20:57
distinct. Pixel 7 has a silky matte finish on the aluminum camera bar and housing with three camera colors, three color options.
21:07
It features a sharp 6.3-inch display, with smaller bezels and 25 percent higher peak brightness, for incredible
21:14
outdoor visibility during the day. Pixel 7 also includes a great all-day battery, with up to 72
21:21
hours between charges when you use extreme battery saver mode. In terms of camera, it sports a dual rear camera system, as well
21:29
as an upgraded, ultrawide front-facing camera with a larger sensor for better night time selfies, and stunning 4K
21:36
video. And we’re taking the Pixel lineup to new heights with Pixel 7 Pro.
21:42
It’s our most advanced phone yet, with a beautiful, sophisticated design and a pro-level camera, with
21:48
performance to match. You can see the premium polished aluminum finish on the camera
21:54
bar and housing, which complements its three colors. Pixel 7 Pro has an upgraded, super-sharp 6.7-inch display.
22:03
With its variable refresh rate, you get responsive gaming and smooth scrolling, without killing your battery.
22:09
Pixel 7 Pro has a triple rear camera system featuring upgraded telephoto and ultrawide cameras.
22:17
Its front-facing ultrawide camera is great for low-light selfies, videos, and more.
22:22
And the front camera has another role to play. Pixel 7 and 7 Pro’s front camera uses our advanced machine
22:29
learning models for face recognition, to power Face Unlock. So you have the faster, more secure under-display fingerprint
22:37
reader, and now you have the convenience of unlocking your phone with a glance.
22:42
You heard Rick speak earlier about the new Tensor G2 chip, our powerful new processor inside Pixel 7 and 7 Pro.
22:51
Our next-generation chip includes a dedicated TPU, so we can bring Google’s state-of-the-art AI and personal intelligence directly to the phone.
22:59
And the entire Tensor G2 chip has been designed to ensure every major sub-system works really well together, to handle
23:05
the complex and nuanced nature of Google's most innovative software and ML capabilities.
23:11
So now, machine learning runs up to 60% faster and up to 20% more efficiently on Pixel 7 and 7 Pro.
23:19
Tensor G2’s design also helps lower the power consumption for everyday phone activities, like recording videos, streaming
23:25
music, speech recognition, and translating conversations. And Tensor G2 makes your smartphone smarter, enabling all
23:33
kinds of technological breakthroughs and magically helpful experiences. With Tensor G2 at its core, Pixel 7 is the best smartphone
23:42
for voice assistance. It's the best phone for calling. It’s the best phone for photography.
23:49
And as you heard from Jen, it's the most secure and private Pixel we've ever made.
23:54
Let’s start with voice assistance. Google’s industry-leading understanding of human language
24:00
and speech powers our most helpful voice experience with new capabilities on Pixel 7 and Pro, thanks to Tensor G2.
24:09
When your phone understands your voice, it opens up so many more possibilities, translating conversations with Live
24:15
Translate, asking Google Assistant endless questions, navigating directly to apps without tapping, and easily
24:22
sending messages. Take Assistant voice typing, which is on average two and a half times faster
24:29
than using a keyboard. On Pixel 7, Assistant voice typing will automatically
24:34
suggest relevant emojis to insert, and it’s much more forgiving now in case you don't know the exact name of the emoji
24:40
you’re looking for. So saying something like "happy emoji" gets you what you want. But that’s an easy one.
24:46
What about “upside down face emoji,” or “heart eyes cat
24:51
emoji,” or “woohoo emoji.” [Laughter] Speaking to your phone can be so
24:57
much more convenient, but listening isn’t always an option When you’re on the receiving end.
25:02
Ever get an audio message when you’re in a quiet place without headphones? It’s frustrating, right? Well, Pixel 7 can now use Google's advanced speech
25:10
recognition model to transcribe your audio messages right in the Messages app, so you can quickly skim them.
25:17
And when it comes to your text messages, Pixel uses RCS for enhanced media sharing and end-to-end encryption.
25:23
RCS is the modern industry standard for messaging, and it’s already been adopted by most of the industry.
25:30
We hope every device maker gets the message and adopts RCS, making texting better for every smartphone user.
25:38
And if there are any reporters in the crowd, you’ll be happy to hear that the Recorder app on Pixel 7 is getting speaker labels later this year.
25:45
So instead of a single transcript of your meeting or interview, on-device speech models will separate the
25:50
speakers for you. Now, what about phone calls?
25:57
Between spammers, customer service phone menus, and bad audio quality, phone calls can be such a hassle.
26:04
So Pixel 7 is designed to be the best phone for actual phone calling. Pixel devices are the only phones with Pixel Call Assist, a
26:12
suite of features that helps with everything from making calls to avoiding them.
26:18
Like Call Screen, which automatically answers unknown callers, asks who's calling, and filters out spammers, based on
26:23
what they say, without ever interrupting you. Our users tell us Call Screen is one of their favorite Pixel
26:29
features. And for good reason. It handled over 600 million calls for users last year.
26:35
And when you call a business, Direct My Call can help you navigate their phone directories without having to listen and
26:41
re-listen to a list of options. Since launching Direct My Call last year, it's helped Pixel
26:46
users navigate over 50 million calls with businesses. With Pixel 7, the direct my call experience gets even easier.
26:55
Instead of listening to a long recorded message describing each option, you'll see a list of menu options right away.
27:01
You can tap the option you want, even before it's spoken. Your phone should also make your phone calls sound better.
27:09
Coming in a feature drop later this year, Clear Calling will make it even easier to hear the other person at the other end of the line.
27:16
Just like the acclaimed background noise suppression on Pixel Buds Pro, Clear Calling uses machine learning to
27:22
recognize, isolate and eliminate distracting sounds like wind and traffic noise, while enhancing your caller's voice.
27:29
So your friends can call you from anywhere, and you'll be able to hear them just fine. The suite of Pixel Call Assist features is the perfect example
27:37
of Tensor G2 and Google's state-of-the-art AI coming together in Pixel 7 to deliver an elevated smartphone
27:43
experience. And as you've seen over the years what our AI can do for a smartphone camera.
27:51
Pixel Camera is what the phone is famous for, and it's once again been rated as the best smartphone camera in the
27:56
industry. Here's Shenaz to tell you what the Pixel 7 camera can do.
28:01
[Applause]. >> SHENAZ: Before Pixel, very few people outside Google and
28:12
academic research had ever heard the term "computational photography", much less applied it to smartphone cameras.
28:21
With Pixel 7 and Google Tensor G2, we continue to lead in computational photography, with a powerful set of features that
28:30
help you take accurate images for every skin tone, fix your
28:36
photos, film high-quality videos, and snap great pictures
28:41
from up close or far away. Let's start with inclusivity.
28:46
It's absolutely critical that Pixel 7's improved photo quality
28:52
extends to everybody. People with darker skin tones are rendered unnaturally when
28:58
photographed by most cameras. So last year, we introduced Real Tone to make our camera and
29:06
image products work more equitably for people of color. And we continue to partner with image experts, both in the U.S.
29:15
and around the world, to help evaluate our Pixel Camera and make sure skin tones are represented beautifully and
29:23
accurately. Over the past year, they've added more than 10,000 images to
29:29
The datasets used to tune Pixel's camera. Through that work, we've tuned exposure and brightness to
29:37
better represent darker skin tones in low-light situations, ensuring everyone looks great in those beautiful Night Sight
29:45
shots on Pixel 7. We've also partnered with a community of BIPOC and
29:51
non-western photographers, editors and visual producers from Diversify Photo to evaluate how we are delivering
30:00
improvements to Real Tone. And with these updates, we're proud to say Pixel is still the
30:08
most inclusive camera. Pixel 7 also improves the accessibility of Pixel's camera.
30:17
Finding that perfect angle for a selfie can be particularly challenging for blind and low-vision users.
30:25
Pixel 7 can solve that, with our new Guided Frame. Here it is in action.
30:36
>> SPEAKER 1: One face. Move your phone slightly left and down.
30:42
Move your phone slightly right and up. Ready for selfie. Three, two, one. Photo taken. One face. >> MOLLY BURKE: Oh, my God.
30:48
I love this. >> SPEAKER 1: One face. Selfie. Move your phone right and up.
30:53
Ready for selfie. >> MOLLY BURKE: Wait. I want to get my light.
31:00
>> SPEAKER 1: One face. Photo taken. Selfie. One face. >> MOLLY BURKE: This is so cool. My name is Molly Burke.
31:06
I am a social media content creator and motivational speaker Who happens to be blind. So often I find accessibility's focused on making sure disabled people can do the bare minimum to get by.
31:13
It's important that accessibility not just focus on designing things to make disabled people function, but
31:18
also empower them to have fun in life again. >> LINGENG WONG: I'm Lingeng Wong.
31:24
I'm one of the original creators of Guided Frame. Guided Frame is a smart selfie feature that helps blind and
31:32
low-vision users to take a beautiful selfie. >> SPEAKER 1: One. Photo taken. >> LINGENG WONG: Selfie to me and to many blind users, I think is
31:38
a way they express themself. >> MOLLY BURKE: For so long I couldn't take selfies because I
31:44
could never frame it correctly. I would try to show a friend a New t-shirt that I got, and I'd
31:49
be like, "Look at how cute this top is." And I'd text her a selfie, and she'd be like, yeah, I can't see it at all. >> LINGENG WONG: In Google, we strive to make our technology
31:58
and product accessible for everyone to use. So it's super important for us to develop a camera experience
32:04
that's inclusive. >> SPEAKER 1: Three, two, one. Photo taken. >> LINGENG WONG: We are constantly checking with our blind and low-vision users because their feedback helps make our product
32:12
much better. >> MOLLY BURKE: My mom is an incredible photographer, but I don't want to always have to rely on my mom to take my
32:20
photos. That's one of those basic, everyday things that gives you that independence that we as disabled people crave.
32:30
>> SHENAZ: With the added -- [Applause].
32:39
With the added accessibility of Guided Frame, and the inclusivity and accuracy of Real Tone, we're continuing
32:46
our ongoing mission to build a more equitable experience across our camera.
32:52
Now, here's a problem that stretches back to the earliest days of photography: Blurry photos.
32:59
It's very easy to blame the camera for a blurry shot, but cameras have always struggled to get a clear photo, especially
33:08
when your kids won't hold still, or when there's not enough light in the room at a party.
33:14
Pixel 7 and Tensor G2 can fix that. So it's easier than ever to take crisper, sharper images, no
33:23
matter how challenging the scene might be. For instance, with Tensor G2's new ML de-noiser, Night Sight is
33:31
now twice as fast, reducing unwanted motion blur and producing beautiful low-light images with the same amount of
33:40
clarity. Of course, we all know blurriness doesn't happen just at night.
33:47
Even during the day, if your hand or your kid is moving too much, or your focus isn't perfect, you'll get blurry
33:54
images. Pixel 7 fixes that by automatically fusing images from
34:00
the ultrawide and main cameras together to help ensure faces are clear.
34:07
Tensor G2 goes even further, using a cutting-edge machine learning approach to remove even more blur in even more photos,
34:17
so your images are incredibly sharp. Now, most of us have a large collection of old photos, but
34:25
you might have taken them on a phone or camera that doesn't quite match the quality of a Pixel phone.
34:32
And that's perfectly fine! Because Pixel 7 can help fix those photos for you with a
34:39
brand new feature called Photo Unblur, which is only available with Google Photos on Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro.
34:50
Photo Unblur uses Tensor G2's machine learning capabilities to remove blur and visual noise from entire images, so now with
35:00
just a few taps, you can relive the moment as clearly as you remember it.
35:06
And you can touch up those old photos with Magic Eraser to quickly and easily remove distractions.
35:13
So all your photos are as good as you want them to be, no matter how old they are.
35:21
One of my colleagues has been using Pixel to make photos of his children, which he has taken over the years, much better.
35:28
Let's take a look.
35:40
[Cheers and Applause].
35:58
>> SHENAZ: Now we are all capturing more and more of our lives through video.
36:08
Pixel 7 brings big improvements to the video camera, so you can create stunning videos you'll want to share.
36:16
For example, we're introducing Cinematic Blur to the Pixel camera.
36:21
With Tensor G2, Pixel 7 can generate very high-quality depth
36:27
information, at low power and low latency.
36:32
Cinematic Blur combines that depth information with high image quality and high dynamic range.
36:39
So for the first time, you can shoot cinema-like videos with a beautifully shallow depth-of-field.
36:47
Tensor G2 powers lots of other video improvements, too, like new 10-bit HDR, so you can record brighter videos with
36:55
wider color ranges and higher contrast. With 10-bit HDR, your videos look more like real life, and
37:03
utilize the full capabilities of Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro's
37:08
amazing displays. We've even partnered with Snap, TikTok and YouTube, so your HDR
37:15
videos look vibrant when shared on your favorite apps. And here's a challenge you've probably run into, getting those
37:23
smooth video shots without any fancy equipment. With our highest quality video stabilization technology, Tensor
37:31
G2 brings together hardware and software to help you get pro-looking videos that capture the moment and not your
37:41
movement. The auto focus is better, too, so your subject stays in focus
37:46
while on the move. Lastly, we're extending our Speech Enhancement and 4K60
37:53
frames per second across all Pixel 7 cameras, so you can be heard clearly without the background noise and record the
38:02
moment in brilliant high resolution. With Cinematic Blur, 10-bit HDR, video stabilization and
38:10
improvements to autofocus and speech enhancement, your videos will look better, sound clearer and feel more professional,
38:19
anywhere you choose to post them. Now let's move on to a common problem for smartphone
38:25
photography: Zoom. And here's Alex to give you an up-close look at our zoom
38:31
technology. [Applause]. >> ALEX: Pro photographers have different zoom lenses to make
38:41
small objects feel life-size, or faraway objects feel within
38:46
reach. These are some of the last frontiers of smartphone photography, where phones haven't been able to truly
38:53
replicate the quality of a DSLR. Historically, packing professional-quality zoom into a
39:01
smartphone hasn't been possible. It was a physics challenge of fitting large optics into just a
39:07
few millimeters of space. Last year, with Pixel 6 Pro, we introduced a folded telephoto
39:13
camera that fits right in the Pixel Camera bar. The result was stunning photos at 4x optical zoom.
39:21
But zoomed photos should look great at a range of distances, not just at the telephoto's optical zoom.
39:29
You should be able to get a sharp photo at any magnification. With Google Tensor G2, Pixel 7 Pro pushes computational
39:37
photography to new heights with Pixel's pro-level zoom. It cleverly combines state-of-the-art hardware,
39:45
software and machine learning to create amazing zoom photos across any magnification.
39:51
This shot came from someone at our Tensor team who's not even a professional photographer. Obviously she didn't want to get too close to an apex predator.
40:00
And with Pixel 7 Pro, she got this beautiful, pro-level image from a safe distance.
40:08
Pixel 7 Pro has the highest quality zoom on a Pixel ever, across the entire zoom range.
40:16
It's like having the power of a DSLR and all the lenses you'd ever need, but it's easy enough for everyone to use, and it fits
40:24
right in your pocket. Let's get into how it works. To start, we know photographers love taking photos at 2x,
40:34
because it's the most similar to their natural perspective. Now, you could add another camera with a 2x telephoto lens,
40:40
but that means a bulkier phone. Pixel 7 Pro can do better, increasing zoom magnification
40:47
without the added bulk. Super Res Zoom has delivered amazing zoom photos since Pixel
40:54
3, and this year we've re-engineered it to go even further, with higher-resolution images.
41:02
Our next-generation Super Res Zoom allows us to roughly double the magnification of our optical lenses.
41:09
So starting at 2x, Super Res Zoom crops Pixel 7 Pro's main
41:14
50 megapixel camera, using a high resolution mode to provide a 12.5 megapixel image.
41:21
It has more resolution than before, but the smaller pixels are also noisier.
41:28
To fix those smaller and noisier pixels, it re-mosaics the image into a traditional bayer format, so our imaging pipeline can
41:36
de-noise it, through HDR+ bracketing, which aligns and merges a burst of frames, giving you high resolution and
41:44
low noise. The result is a full 12.5 megapixel photo at 2x that looks
41:51
stunning, and similar to what you would get from a dedicated 2x telephoto camera. And because both phones share the same large main sensor, you
42:00
can get this high-quality 2x shot on both Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 7.
42:07
Okay. So what if you want to zoom in just a little more, but not all the way to the optical zoom?
42:13
That's no problem with pro-level zoom. Keep zooming on your Pixel 7 Pro, and Super Res Zoom takes a
42:19
photo from both the telephoto and the main camera. Then a new ML model on Tensor G2 aligns and fuses these together
42:29
to create a composite that's as sharp as possible. So you get great zoom quality, even between the two cameras.
42:37
As you keep pinching to zoom, Pixel 7 Pro's upgraded 5x telephoto camera kicks in.
42:43
And Tensor G2 powers a new ML autofocus algorithm that ensures your photos are sharp and detailed.
42:51
Now here's my favorite bit of tech. Pinch to zoom in to 10x, and Super Res Zoom performs the same
42:58
process it does at 2x, to create a full 12MP photo that's similar
43:03
to a dedicated 10x telephoto camera. So with Super Res Zoom on Pixel 7 Pro, you don't just get one
43:11
telephoto camera. You get a 2x, a 5x and a 10x helping you capture amazing
43:18
photos across a variety of magnifications. No DSLR or external lenses required.
43:26
As you zoom in even more, hand motion starts to become an issue.
43:31
At 15x zoom, even small movements translate into jarring changes in the viewfinder, and this can make composition really
43:39
hard. Pixel 7 Pro's Zoom Stabilization keeps your camera steady when
43:45
zooming past 15x. It identifies the subject in the viewfinder, then stabilizes the
43:50
camera on it, even if your hands are drifting or shaking. That makes it easier to zoom in even further.
43:58
At 20x, pro-level zoom uses a new ML model on Tensor G2 that upscales your photos to provide even more resolution.
44:08
So now you'll be able to take amazing, detailed photos all the way up to 30x, the largest zoom magnification ever on a Pixel.
44:17
And it couldn't be easier. Just pinch in the viewfinder, and your Pixel 7 Pro takes care of the rest with the highest quality zoom at any range on a
44:26
Pixel. But what if you want to get up close? Like, really close.
44:33
Pixel 7 Pro's new ultrawide lens is 21 percent wider than Pixel 7's, and it now has autofocus, which powers our New Macro
44:41
Focus. So now you can get vivid close-ups of objects as close as
44:46
three centimeters away, with Pixel's signature HDR+ quality. Now, that's close enough to photograph rain drops,
44:56
individual flower petals, grains of pollen, and the most minute
45:01
details of what makes us, us, in full sharpness and vibrant
45:07
color. It's a great way to make magnificent shots from the everyday, showing that even the smallest details matter.
45:16
With the combination of Macro Focus and our next generation Super Res Zoom, Pixel 7 Pro delivers gorgeous,
45:24
detailed photos at .5x, at 30x, and everywhere in between.
45:31
Back over to you, Brian.
45:37
[Applause]. >> BRIAN: So that's Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the only phones
45:43
with Google Tensor G2, so they're the best phones for photography, from sharpening your photos, to getting you in
45:50
closer, to letting you shoot cinema-quality video, and accurately reflecting every shade of skin.
45:56
They're the best phones for calling, with Pixel Call Assist. They're the best phones for voice assistance, with Live
46:03
Translate, and Assistant voice typing. And they're our most secure and private phones yet, with Tensor
46:09
G2, Titan M2, the new VPN by Google One, and so many other protections built in.
46:16
Pixel 7 is engineered to understand you and your world, putting Google's personalized intelligence right in your hand.
46:23
Pixel 7 Pro is Google's most powerful phone. It brings serious performance, and an upgraded telephoto lens,
46:30
with the highest quality zoom on a smartphone yet. Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are the pinnacle of Pixel helpfulness,
46:37
and we're making them available to even more users in more places. They're available for pre-order starting today, and on-shelf
46:44
next week. We want people to give Pixel 7 a try. So while phones in this tier typically start at $799, we're
46:51
setting the starting price at just $599. The Pixel 7 Pro starts at $899, much lower than other flagship
46:59
devices. And we have some great offers from Google and our carrier partners. Here in the U.S., you can get a Pixel 7 Pro with up to $899 back
47:07
with an eligible trade-in. And if you're looking for the ultimate companion to Pixel 7
47:13
and Pixel 7 Pro, well, James has some exciting news for you. [Applause].
47:18
>> JAMES: Hey, everyone. We're so excited today to finally give you a complete
47:27
look at our new flagship Google Pixel Watch. It's the first smartwatch to deliver the best of Google and
47:35
Fitbit, and it's the perfect companion to your Pixel devices. Pixel Watch features a beautiful, custom-developed 3D
47:43
cover glass that's tough and scratch-resistant, and the curved form makes it unique and inviting.
47:50
There's no device more personal than the one you wear all day. So Pixel Watch is designed to reflect your personal style,
47:56
with all the watch bands and customizable watch faces Isabelle showed you earlier. The combinations are endless, and just as importantly, Pixel
48:04
Watch is designed to understand you and your needs throughout the day. Every time you glance at your Pixel Watch, it's doing
48:11
something helpful for you, not just prompting you to pick up another device.
48:16
It quickly delivers the notifications you want, without creating the distractions you don't.
48:22
With Pixel Watch, you can simplify your life with the best of Google on your wrist. Adjust your thermostat from your watch with the Google Home app.
48:30
Listen to your favorite artists with YouTube Music, whether you're on a run without your phone, or just running an
48:36
errand. Set your favorite Google Photos images as a custom watch face.
48:41
See quick notifications from Gmail and Calendar. Make checkout and transit a breeze with Google Wallet.
48:49
Get turn-by-turn directions directly on your watch with Google Maps. And with Google Assistant, you can use your voice to do quick
48:56
actions like sending messages, setting timers, controlling your music and starting your run.
49:03
Beyond Google integrations, Wear OS unlocks a rich ecosystem of your favorite experiences, from the Bitmoji watchface to apps
49:11
like Line, Adidas Running, Strava, Calm, Spotify, and so
49:17
many more. Of course, it's not just an incredibly helpful smartwatch.
49:23
Pixel Watch is also the first Wear OS device with Fitbit. It's a powerful pairing, combining Google's expertise in
49:31
designing helpful experiences for billions of people with the best health and fitness insights from Fitbit.
49:38
Together, Google and Fitbit deliver a personal smartwatch experience like none other.
49:45
Pixel Watch uses a combination of on-device machine learning and deep optimization, down to the processor level, to give you
49:52
an accurate measurement of your heart rate continuously at once per second.
49:58
Whether you're working out or resting, and all the times in between. While maintaining an all-day battery life up to 24 hours.
50:08
By joining the expertise of Fitbit and Google's machine learning teams, Pixel Watch is powered by Fitbit's most
50:14
accurate heart rate tracking yet. This level of all-day, accurate heart rate tracking is so much
50:21
more useful than the less frequent intervals of other smartwatches. Here's an inside look at how Pixel Watch achieves this
50:29
incredible milestone. >> TRACY GIEST: The Google Pixel Watch tracks heart rate like
50:36
time, down to the second. >> DECARLOS LOVE: Fitbit plus Google. Both sides are bringing great expertise.
50:41
We had a vision of delivering a great health and fitness experience powered by a great heart rate tracking experience.
50:48
>> TRACY GIEST: Tracking heart rate on the wrist specifically is incredibly challenging. >> YOJAN PATEL: To measure heart rate we use a sensor called a
50:54
photoplethysmograph. The photo means light. And essentially what we're trying to do is determine the
50:59
effects of light on your pulse. >> MAREK DONIEC: The main challenge is measurement noise, noise that comes in from things such as your motion.
51:07
>> TRACY GIEST: There's a lot to consider in terms of leveraging the different sensors to make it as accurate as possible.
51:13
>> DECARLOS LOVE: Everyone knows that Google is great at AI, but getting a chance firsthand to see what that really means was
51:19
amazing. >> TRACY GIEST: We started by gathering thousands of hours of training data from our participants, both in the
51:25
research labs as well as during their real world usage. >> MAREK DONIEC: And machine learning helps us basically take
51:30
all of this data and pull all the common patterns both in everyday life during their everyday exercises, learn to
51:38
reject the noise, and in the end generate an accurate heart rate. >> DECARLOS LOVE: The true benefit is recognizing patterns.
51:45
If we can understand what the user is doing, we can then give those insights. Heart rate tracking and the overall activity tracking is
51:51
really important for that. >> TRACY GIEST: Honestly, working on this heart rate project really taught me that amazing things are possible. >> DECARLOS LOVE: It really was a culmination of multiple years,
52:00
several iterations involving a lot of teams, and the end result of that is allowing us to have our most accurate heart rate
52:05
tracking yet. >> SPEAKER 5: What's your heart rate right now? >> MAREK DONIEC: Actually, I'm at 70, so not too bad.
52:15
>> TRACY GIEST: 87. >> MAREK DONIEC: 69. 68. >> YOJAN PATEL: It's 101.
52:20
>> DECARLOS LOVE: Cool 74. >> JAMES: Let's see, what's my heart rate? It's 91, so it's a little elevated.
52:26
So a little elevated, but I think the most important thing is heart rate is the foundation of the Fitbit experience you
52:32
love, and of so many important fitness and health metrics. Heart rate tells you how hard you're going in workouts, but it
52:39
also tells you how well your body is resting between activities. It even lends insights into the quality of your sleep.
52:47
With rich heart rate data, you can use your Daily Readiness score with Fitbit Premium to assess whether you're ready to
52:52
work out or should prioritize recovery. And during your workout, Pixel Watch will track Active Zone
52:58
Minutes, which helps you maximize the time you spend in your target heart rate zones, so you get credit and make every
53:05
workout productive. You'll be able to assess your heart rate rhythm for AFib with the ECG app, and provide peace-of-mind for you and your
53:13
loved ones with Emergency SOS. And Fall Detection is coming in 2023 to detect hard falls and
53:20
alert emergency services on your behalf. Even better, every Pixel Watch comes with six months of Fitbit
53:27
Premium. Following along to more than 1,000 workouts, from HIIT to yoga to sport-specific workouts, like golf or soccer.
53:36
And you'll have access to over 400 pieces of mindfulness content, like guided breathing, sleep stories and relaxing
53:43
sounds. Fitbit Premium also provides a personalized Wellness Report and Health Metrics Dashboard with crucial wellness metrics like
53:51
breathing rate, heart rate variability and resting heart rate. On top of all that, we're bringing the Sleep Tracking
53:58
experience you know and love from Fitbit to Pixel Watch. We've been a pioneer in this field with over 20 billion
54:05
nights tracked, and we continue to improve our sleep tracking with new ways to help you get your best night's rest.
54:13
Check your Sleep Score each morning and see your sleep stage breakdown for light sleep, REM and deep sleep.
54:21
You can also check the Fitbit app to see your long-term sleep trends. Use those insights to understand your sleep quality and build
54:29
healthy habits to get the best rest every night, feel more energized, reduce stress and improve your overall well-being.
54:37
The mainstream understanding of fitness is finally starting to come around to the idea that rest is just as important as
54:46
activity. So, for those looking to get a better understanding of their bodies, and establish a healthy, positive relationship with
54:53
exercise, Pixel Watch is an incredible way to jump in. The most important thing about Pixel Watch is that it's
55:00
designed to help you get out there and do things. Paired with Pixel 7, it's the most personal Pixel device yet,
55:07
making it easy to keep track of your days, your nights and your life.
55:14
Google Pixel Watch starts at $349, and it's available for pre-order today, and on-shelves starting next week.
55:21
And enjoy three months of YouTube Music Premium on us, in addition to the six months of Fitbit Premium.
55:28
So that's Google Pixel Watch. Bringing the best of Fitbit and Google together in a wearable
55:35
that delivers the help you need, at the gym, on the couch, and everywhere in between.
55:42
Next up, Rose will preview a new device coming to our portfolio, Pixel's take on the tablet.
55:49
[Applause]. >> ROSE: Thank you, James!
55:57
Earlier this year, we gave you a sneak peek at our newest product, coming in 2023.
56:02
We hope what you see today will get you just as excited as we are. The Pixel family doesn't feel complete without a larger
56:09
screen. We set out to build a device that brings together recent advances in Android, Tensor's personal
56:16
intelligence, and our Pixel design. The result is a device only Google could make, Google Pixel Tablet.
56:24
It's the perfect companion to your Pixel phone and your smart home devices.
56:30
We designed Pixel Tablet with premium materials and finishes, as well as smooth, rounded corners to make it an
56:37
unmistakable part of the Pixel family. The gorgeous display means you can immerse yourself in your
56:44
favorite shows, video calls, games, photos and more.
56:51
The foundation for Pixel Tablet is Android, including Material You, so you can completely personalize it with a custom
56:58
color palette and new color variants based on your wallpaper and lock screens.
57:03
And just as our Pixel phones have always been the best and purest expression of Android, Pixel Tablet is the best way to
57:12
experience Android on a tablet. You saw the core of that work at I/O earlier this year.
57:18
Since then, we've partnered closely with developers to make sure apps take advantage of large screen features like split
57:24
screen and stylus support. We want to thank developers for working closely with us and giving us great feedback.
57:32
This is also the first time that we're bringing the power of Google Tensor G2 to an all-new form factor.
57:40
With Tensor G2's advanced image processing and machine learning, Pixel Tablet has a whole new level of personalized
57:47
intelligence and understanding. That means your favorite Pixel phone features, like video
57:52
calling, photo editing, and hands-free help with Google Assistant will work seamlessly on a large-screen device.
58:00
Now, one of the best things about tablets is that people use them in so many different ways.
58:06
They can be such versatile devices. So when we began designing Pixel Tablet, one of the first things
58:12
we asked ourselves was, how can we make a tablet that's always helpful for everyone?
58:19
We spent a lot of time talking to people about how they use their tablets, and what they love and don't love about them.
58:27
And we heard an interesting theme emerge. It turns out that tablets are homebodies.
58:32
They're at home 80 percent of the time, but they're only useful for a small portion of the day.
58:38
The rest of the time, tablets feel out of place in our homes. Hidden away in a drawer, misplaced, presenting a tripping
58:47
hazard, or just out of battery. So we set out to build something better.
58:52
With Pixel Tablet, we're taking everything we've learned from years of making products for the home and for Pixel and combining
59:00
it into one great device. It reimagines how a tablet can actually be helpful all the time
59:08
in your home by pairing it with a new Charging Speaker Dock. Ta-da!
59:13
Let's take a moment! [Cheers and Applause]. It keeps your device charged.
59:20
It makes your tablet helpful 24/7, and it unlocks a whole new set of experiences in the home.
59:27
Now, as a busy working parent, I love how Pixel Tablet and the dock is bringing some of the best features from a smart
59:33
display to a tablet. The enhanced audio experience from the speaker lets me enjoy
59:39
my favorite show while I'm cooking in the kitchen, or have an impromptu dance party with my daughter.
59:45
The hands-free help from the Assistant is, of course, a life-saver. Like saying, "hey Google, play classical music," when I want to relax at the end of the day.
59:54
My Pixel Tablet also gives me easy control over all my smart home devices. So I can turn the lights off in the house and set the thermostat
1:00:02
to the perfect sleep temperature without ever getting out of bed.
1:00:07
And my favorite Pixel Tablet feature is seeing my memories curated by Google Photos while
1:00:13
it's docked. I love glancing over during a busy workday and seeing a photo of my kids as babies.
1:00:20
Isn't he cute? It always makes me smile, and my kids love it, too.
1:00:25
And of course, the dock itself serves as a charger, so your tablet is always ready for hours of entertainment.
1:00:31
Now, we took special care to tuning the magnets so you can easily dock or undock the Pixel Tablet.
1:00:39
And when it's in your hand, the premium nanoceramic finish is both beautiful and comfortable.
1:00:45
I love leaning back at the end of the day for a little retail therapy.
1:00:51
The Pixel Tablet is designed to seamlessly transition from a delightful part of your home to an entertainment device you can
1:00:58
take anywhere, making it one of the most versatile and adaptable tablets ever.
1:01:06
Combining these features with the dock's beautiful design, and you'll want to have Pixel Tablet in the heart of your home.
1:01:11
It transforms your tablet from something that sits in your drawer to an integral part of your life.
1:01:17
And we can't wait to share more When it's available next year. Next up, Seang is going to show you how the entire Pixel
1:01:25
portfolio works together to provide magically helpful experiences at home and on the go.
1:01:35
[Applause]. >> SEANG: We've spent the past few years building a cohesive
1:01:44
portfolio of devices and services. Earlier this week, you saw our home portfolio expand
1:01:50
with a new Nest Doorbell, and Nest Wifi Pro. And today, you saw the latest members of the Pixel Family.
1:01:58
No other company offers such a wide range of helpful products for home and on the go.
1:02:03
Now, I want to share how those products all come together to unlock all kinds of helpful ambient experiences.
1:02:11
Let's start with the basics. Setting up and keeping track of your devices should be seamless
1:02:17
and simple. So we have technologies like Fast Pair to help your Pixel phone quickly sync and work together with all your devices,
1:02:25
whether they're made by Google or by one of our Fast Pair partners. With Fast Pair, you're set up in seconds.
1:02:32
It's a seamless, simple experience instead of a frustrating one. There are lots of everyday helpful things like that.
1:02:40
You shouldn't have to log into the same wifi network with your different devices. Log in with your Pixel phone, and your Google Pixel Watch will
1:02:47
connect, too. And how many of us have panicked when we realize our phone is missing?
1:02:53
Use Find My Device to figure out where you left it, or say, "Hey Google, find my phone" on your watch to ring your phone when
1:03:00
it's lost in the couch cushions. We're making it easy to move your media, too.
1:03:05
If you're watching a video on your phone, you can cast it to your TV with just a touch.
1:03:11
And beyond those simple fundamentals, all of our products are designed to be more helpful together.
1:03:16
Especially in moments that are most important to people, like getting quick answers to your questions, controlling your
1:03:24
smart home, and taking photos. What if it was easier to take, edit and share a fun photo
1:03:32
across your devices? What kinds of magical experiences could that unlock?
1:03:38
Let's explore. It starts with an incredible camera on Pixel 7 to capture the
1:03:44
moment. And here's a little Google magic for your group selfie. Open the camera app on your watch, zoom in with the rotating
1:03:52
crown and take a picture on your Pixel 7's camera, all from your watch.
1:03:58
No more selfie arm in the group pic. If you want to make your photo absolutely perfect, open it on
1:04:04
your Pixel Tablet, where you can edit your images on a larger screen. Once you're done editing, it's safely stored in Google Photos.
1:04:12
And with the power of machine learning, we'll resurface the memories you want to relive, and filter out the shots that you
1:04:18
don't. Enjoy those amazing memories on your watch face, on the Pixel Tablet, or Nest Hub in your kitchen, or your bedroom
1:04:25
flatscreen with Google TV. Now let's talk about getting help when you need it.
1:04:32
We all have those moments when our hands are full, or we're in the middle of something, and pulling out your phone to send a
1:04:37
quick text or look something up is a hassle. Here's where your voice comes in.
1:04:42
Asking for what you need is often faster and more natural than tapping or typing on your screen to get small tasks done.
1:04:51
And there's so much you can do with your voice across our products with the power of Tensor and our best speech
1:04:56
recognition yet. When you're on your way home with some coffee, say, "Hey Google, broadcast that I'm coming home with coffee," and
1:05:03
your message will play on the smart speakers throughout your house. And once you're home, the help comes with you.
1:05:10
Traditionally, the smart home has been broken up into a bunch ofsiloed experiences.
1:05:16
It's harder than it should be. So here's where Pixel helpfulness really comes to life as a better smart home controller.
1:05:24
We've designed our Pixel portfolio so every device is a control panel and works seamlessly with the new Google
1:05:31
Home app. Now you can easily manage your many smart home devices from your phone.
1:05:37
Or your watch. Or your Pixel Buds with just your voice. Wherever you are, you're always just a few taps away from your
1:05:45
home. Forgot to turn out the lights and lock your doors as you rush to work? Do it from your phone.
1:05:53
With your Nest doorbell, you don't have to get up when someone comes to your door. You'll get a notification telling you who or what's there,
1:06:00
on your Pixel Watch, or your phone, or whichever device is closest to you.
1:06:05
With Pixel, interruptions don't interrupt you anymore. And at the end of a long day, just say, "Hey Google, turn on
1:06:14
relaxation time." And a custom routine can set the mood with your smart lights, and
1:06:20
the calming sounds of your favorite playlist. It's a more flexible, more ambient approach to hardware,
1:06:26
and it's all about delivering the help you need, wherever and whenever you need it.
1:06:33
Next up, we'll have a few final thoughts from Rick to wrap up the show.
1:06:41
Rick? [Applause]. >> RICK: The Pixel family is finally all coming together.
1:06:50
A growing portfolio all harnessing Google's state-of-the-art AI to
1:06:56
understand your needs and make life easier. That's what makes a Pixel a Pixel.
1:07:02
It's a level of helpfulness and personal intelligence that's totally unique in the mobile computing world.
1:07:09
Like a smartphone that uses AI to help you take the best photos you've ever shot, answers the phone when you don't want to,
1:07:18
and helps you communicate in different languages. A watch that delivers the best of Google and Fitbit together.
1:07:28
A tablet that's at home in your hands, and in your home.
1:07:35
It all comes together in a portfolio of Pixel devices built on Google's state-of-the-art AI, Android, and our Tensor mobile
1:07:43
platform. It's a foundation we'll be building on for years to come.
1:07:49
We can't wait for you to try this personal computing experience for yourself, when the newest members of the Pixel
1:07:54
family hit store shelves next week. You can pre-order the new Google Pixel Watch, Pixel 7, Pixel 7
1:08:02
Pro and our newest Nest devices right now in our online Google store.
1:08:07
I hope you love them as much as we do. And thank you so much for watching today!
1:08:28
[Applause].
